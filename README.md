# Excel-Assignment
Within this project I was provided crowddfunding data and analyzed it through several metrics. These metrics included:
  - Using conditional formatting to fill each cell in the outcome column with a different color, depending on whether the
  associated campaign was successful, failed, canceled, or is currently live
  - Using conditional formatting to fill each cell in the Percent Funded column according to a three-color scale.
  - Creating a new column called Average Donation that uses a formula to find how much each project backer paid on average.
  - Creating two new columns, one called Parent Category and another called Sub-Category, that use formulas to split the Category
  and Sub-Category column into the two new, separate columns.
  - Creating a new sheet with a pivot table that analyzes your initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, 
  canceled, or are currently live per category.
  and 
  - Create a new sheet with a pivot table that has a column of outcome, rows of Date Created Conversion, values based on the count of outcome,
  and filters based on parent category and Years.
  
  Attached is also a word document that includes some additional analysis of the datasheet
